# normalize line endings
# From the git documentation: "This ensures that all files that Git considers
# to be text will have normalized (LF) line endings in the repository."
# But files will have native line endings when checked out into the working directory.
* text=auto
 
# tell git which files should be normalized (i.e. which files are text)
*.txt text
*.cpp text
*.c text
*.h text
*.hpp text
